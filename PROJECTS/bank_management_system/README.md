# Bank Management System

This is a simple C++ program that simulates a bank management system. It allows users to open accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and display account information.

## Usage

The program will then display a menu of options. You can choose an option by entering the corresponding number. For example, to open an account, you would enter `1`. The program will then prompt you for the necessary information, such as the account holder's name and the initial balance.

Once you have chosen an option, the program will perform the corresponding operation. For example, if you choose to deposit money, the program will prompt you for the amount to deposit. The program will then update the account balance accordingly.

The program will continue to run until you choose the `Exit` option.
