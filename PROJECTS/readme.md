## PROJECTS GOTTEN FROM THE BOOK 'OOP USING C++' BY JOYCE FARELL

## Project 1 Explanation (teachers_pet_software)

- Teacher’s Pet is a software firm that specializes in children’s educational programs. 
- The firm has decided to develop a series of products that will help children discover the properties of
fractions. 
- As you plan the program series, you realize that a fraction contains at least two data
properties: a numerator and a denominator. Therefore, you begin to think of specific fractions
as objects that belong to the class called Fraction. 
- For now, though, you decide to work with structs. Develop the Fraction struct so that it contains public data fields that hold the integers numerator and denominator. 
- (In later chapters, you will change your data structure to a class and learn to make these data fields private.) Write a main()function that declares a Fraction and allows you to enter data values for the two Fraction fields. Echo the input. Save the file as Fraction.cpp
