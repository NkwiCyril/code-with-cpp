Compute and display the total cost of the job at $200 per day plus $40 per hour for any partial day. Save the file as Floor.cpp.

4. Write a program that allows the user to enter two values. Display the results of adding the two values, subtracting them from each other, multiplying them, and dividing them. Save the file as MathExercise.cpp.

5.  a. Write a program for a bank that allows the user to enter an amount of      money in cents. Display the number of whole dollars the bank will give the customer in exchange. Save the file as DollarConversion.cpp .
    b. Modify the program in 5a so that, in addition to the cents, the user enters the denomination of the coin to which to convert the pennies, such as 5 for nickels or 25 for quarters. Save the file as ChangeConversion.cpp.
