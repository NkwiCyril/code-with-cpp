## code-with-cpp
minimal and advanced programming with c++

## aim
to code with cpp and also help anyone who wishes to code in cpp

## advantage
- understand every line of code with comments and with the aid of .md files
- solve lots of algorithmic problems

## WORTHY NOTES
- It is a better practice to use the 'std::' at each line where you want to use a content of the c++ standard library rather than calling the whole standard library using 'using namespace std;' e.g std:: cout << "Hello World!" is better practice than calling the whole library using namespace std
